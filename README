Bayesian nonparametric lifetime analysis (BNP-LA) is a software packaged developed base on the framework described 
in "Fluorescence Lifetime: Beating the IRF and interpulse window" by Mohamadreza Fazel, Alexander Vallmitjana, 
Lorenzo Scipioni, Enrico Gratton, Michelle A. Digman and Steve Presse, Biophysical Journal (2023). 

BNP-LA is capable of dealing with a broad range of lifetimes and photon ratios using as few photons as 500
acquired using a pulsed illumination procedure. The MATLAB software package comes with a gui and here we 
illustrate how to work with the gui. To open the gui set your MATLAB path to the Functios-folder and type 
gui in the command window. The gui has 4 sections:

1) Exp Params: this section contains calibrated parameters from the experimental setup:
          Interpulse time: the period between two consecutive laser pulses in ns (Default: 12.8ns)
          IRF mean:        mean of the Gaussian IRF in ns (Default: 12.2ns)
          IRF sigma:       sigma of the Gaussian IRF in ns (Default: 0.66ns)
          
2) Method Params: parameters of the analysis method which are mostly good as they are
	  Max Species:     Maximum number of species (described by M in the paper) to be considered in the
	  		   Dirichlet process. This should be larger than the number of species present in 
	  		   the input data (Default: 5)
	  Max Pulses:      Maximum number of pulses that a fluorophore might stay excited (Default: 5)
	  Alpha:	   parameter of the gamma prior on lifetimes (Default: 1)
	  Beta:	           parameter of the gamma prior on lifetimes (Default: 50)
	  
3) Section with no title: 
	  Photon Count:    number of photons to be used within the analysis (should be smaller than the total
                           input photons)
	  Iterations:      number of samples to be taken from the posterior (more samples tend to give better 
                           results)
	  LOAD DATA:       this button popups a directory where data file can be selected
	  RUN:             this button runs the algorithm
	  
4) Results:
	  Photon Ratio Threshold: this is a key parameter in plotting of the results. All plots will show histograms
                                  of samples with photon ratios (weights) larger than this threshold value
	  Parameter:              pick one of the options from the popup menu to be shown
	  PLOT:                   this button will plot the results for the parameter picked above
	  
	  
The package contains a set of simulated data with lifetimes of 0.2ns and 0.6ns (both below the default IRF sigma) with 
the default parameters in the gui. Use the load button to load the data and hit RUN. It will take less than 30s to 
analyze the data. Next, select one of the parameters from the popup menu in the "Results" section and hit PLOT.   
Note: the default number of iterations is 2500 but this value is data dependent and some data sets might need 
larger number of iterations. Specifically, data sets containing 3 or more species or more similar lifetimes require 
more iterations (samples) wich, in turn, leads to more computational complexity.
